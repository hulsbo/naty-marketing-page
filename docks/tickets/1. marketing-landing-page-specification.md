# Marketing Landing Page Implementation
**Goal:** Build a high-end, elegant marketing landing page for Naty, a Contorsion Artist, with a circus theatre aesthetic.
**Context/Tech Stack:** Frontend web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS or framework of choice).

---

## 1. Overall Goal & Scope
The goal is to create a professional, dramatic, and minimalist landing page that serves as a premium digital portfolio for a contorsion artist. The page must convey "Extreme flexibility. Elegant control. Unforgettable presence." through deep red, black, and gold accents, smooth scrolling, and elegant transitions.

Key deliverables:
- Hero section with dramatic visual impact and primary "Book the Act" CTA.
- Biography section highlighting the artist's journey with a CV link.
- "On Stage" promo videos section featuring embedded performances.
- Final wave-off/contact section for conversions.
- Persistent social media links and a blog link in the footer.
- Integration of provided logo and styling assets: `@graphics/naty-logo.png` and `@graphics/sprite-1.png`.
- Utilization of the photography from `@graphics/images/` across the site to establish the visual aesthetic (Hero background, Biography imagery, Video thumbnails, and Contact section backdrop).

## 2. Discussion: Challenges & Solutions
- **Performance & Media:** High-quality videos and large hero media can impact load times.
  *Solution:* Lazy load videos, use optimized formats, and ensure thumbnails are high quality. Rely on CSS transitions for smooth animations rather than heavy JS libraries.
- **Responsive Layout:** The video section needs a 3-column layout on desktop but a stacked vertical 9:16 layout on mobile.
  *Solution:* Use CSS Grid/Flexbox to seamlessly adapt the layout based on breakpoints.
- **Brand Consistency:** The deep red, black, and gold theme needs to be consistent and incorporate the provided logo and sprite assets elegantly.
  *Solution:* Define a strict CSS variable color palette early on and use the assets as central design anchors.

## 3. PR Implementation Plan

*Note: PRs are structured to be atomic and represent incremental steps (commits/PRs) towards the final page.*

### PR 1: Project Skeleton & Theming Setup
**Goal:** Initialize the project and establish the global design system.
**Scope:**
- Set up the basic HTML structure or project scaffold.
- Define global CSS variables (colors: deep red, black, gold accents; typography).
- Add the `naty-logo.png` and `sprite-1.png` to the project assets.
- Create the global Header/Footer layout shell.
**Test Criteria:** Global styles apply correctly; basic layout is responsive; color palette is strictly adhered to.

### PR 2: Hero Presentation Section
**Goal:** Build the above-the-fold visual impact section.
**Scope:**
- Implement a full-viewport (`100vh`) section.
- Add the dramatic background image setup (e.g., using `IMG_3842.jpeg` or another performance shot from `@graphics/images/`) with spotlight styling.
- Center the Naty logo and style the selling sentence.
- Create and style the primary "Book the Act" CTA button.
**Test Criteria:** Section takes up exactly 100vh; logo and text are centered and readable against the background; CTA button has correct hover states.

### PR 3: Biography Section
**Goal:** Implement the storytelling and credibility section.
**Scope:**
- Create a clean, high-contrast text layout for the bio paragraph.
- Integrate a portrait/performance image from `@graphics/images/` to accompany the biography text.
- Style the typography to match the elegant, professional theme.
- Add the secondary "See My CV" CTA button/link.
**Test Criteria:** Text is highly legible on dark/deep red backgrounds; responsive padding/margins are correct on mobile and desktop.

### PR 4: Promo Videos Section ("On Stage")
**Goal:** Add the embedded video gallery.
**Scope:**
- Implement a responsive grid layout (3 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile).
- Add 3 embedded video placeholders, using photography from `@graphics/images/` as high-quality fallback thumbnails.
- Add interaction logic: autoplay on hover for desktop, tap to play for mobile (muted by default).
**Test Criteria:** Grid collapses correctly on mobile (9:16 aspect ratio maintained); hover/tap interactions trigger video playback as expected.

### PR 5: Final Wave-Off, Contact & Footer Integration
**Goal:** Finalize the conversion points and social connectivity.
**Scope:**
- Build the visually lighter but theatrical final contact section, incorporating a subtle background image from `@graphics/images/`.
- Add the closing sentence and primary "Contact Me" CTA.
- Implement sticky minimal social media icons on the edge of the screen.
- Build the minimal black footer with repeated social icons, blog link, and copyright.
**Test Criteria:** Sticky icons remain visible while scrolling; footer links are clickable and correctly aligned; "Contact Me" triggers email/form.

### PR 6: Polish & Animations
**Goal:** Add the "high-end circus theatre" feel with motion.
**Scope:**
- Implement smooth scrolling for anchor links.
- Add subtle reveal animations and elegant transitions as sections scroll into view.
- Perform final responsive and cross-browser fine-tuning.
**Test Criteria:** Page feels premium and dramatic; no janky scrolling or broken transitions; works seamlessly across varying screen sizes.
